## Landing

This page serves as the main landing for the website.
From here, the user can either sign in or register. At the moment, the "sign-in" and "register" buttons are not responsive yet, but the "login" button in the top right is functional.

## Sign-In / Register

To unlock full functionality of the app, the user must sign-in to the page with their credentials.
If they do not have an account, they will have the ability to register for one.

## Profile Page
A dashboard of sorts, the profile page provides the user convenient ways to add their status and list previous statuses. More personalization may be implemented in the future (e.g. name, date, number of times the user has checked in).

## Add Availability

With this COVID Tracker application, the user has the option to add their COVID Status for the day using the form. The user only needs to indicate if their status is "clear" or "not clear" and then the application will automatically record the date and time on submission of the form.

## Edit Interests

With this COVID Tracker application, the user has the option to list their previous COVID Statuses. Additionally, the user can edit all inputted statuses, but we may limit this functionality in the future to only the current day.
